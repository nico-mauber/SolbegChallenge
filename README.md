THERE IS A .BACPAC WITH EMPLOYEE TABLE AND SOME EMPLOYEES INSIDE.

The project is a SPA with react and .NET. This interacts with a DBMS that provides data.

The application can add, delete, and modify data from the employee table.

Each action is represented by a button at the front-end level.

Each action has a modal to view or confirm the action.

The DB configuration is located in SolbegChallengeContext.js.

It is a layered application. There is a graphic layer, a logical layer and a data layer.

Dependency injection is used to communicate the layers.

The components are user-friendly and clear with their objective.
